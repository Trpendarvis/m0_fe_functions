# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
Time can quickly slip away from me if I am not focusing it. I have been getting better at assisting myself with setting alarms to remind me that time has passed or to take a quick break/ get food. This is a weakness of mine since I am new to this type of learning/ study, but I think using technology like my phone to set alarms has already started to prove to be very useful to my success. 
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
I really loved the analogy that the lesson shared about cooking and how its related to functions, I would probably use an analogy to help explain functions to someone without any code knowledge, like a 5 year old, I would describe JS functions as a box of mac n cheese. The box has everything in it like the ingredients and instructions but you still need someone to read the instructions to make it.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Arguments: is the actual data (booleans, numbers, and strings). Parameters: are the values of functions they set what a function is (storage.) {}.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
I think learning about functions has really help to tie up a lot of loose ends for me since this topic helped to define a lot about JS and how it is structured. The main thing I want to focus on is the order of operations for the code which to my understanding mostly comes with time.
